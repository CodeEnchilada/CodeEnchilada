# Turning Numbers into Insights: How I Help Organizations Improve

👋 Hi, I’m @PatternsOfChange, and I’m passionate about using data to understand how organizations work and how they can transform for the better.

I specialize in analyzing numbers that tell stories about how people behave within organizations—whether in the public or private sector. By digging into this data, I uncover patterns and insights that help firms improve how they operate. 

For example, I might analyze how employees spend their time in meetings versus actual work and identify areas where processes can be streamlined. This kind of analysis can help a company save time and money while making their teams work more efficiently.

🌱 I’m currently diving deeper into advanced behavioral science models and how they can be applied to data-driven organizational transformations. I’m learning every day about **R**, **Python**, and how to turn data into actionable insights that make a real impact.

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that use quantitative analysis to drive meaningful change in both public and private organizations. If you're working on something exciting, I’d love to hear about it!
